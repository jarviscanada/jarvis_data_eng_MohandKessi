###### Table Setup (DDL)

###### Question 1: Insert a new facillity

    INSERT INTO cd.facilities
    (facid, name, membercost, guestcost, initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance)
    VALUES (9, 'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800);       

###### Questions 2: Let's try adding the spa to the facilities table again. This time, though, we want to automatically generate the value for the next facid, rather than specifying it as a constant.
